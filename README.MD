# Orcs Must Die Modding Repository

This repo contains a variety of useful tools and links for modding the Orcs Must Die franchise - specifically aiming itself at OMD3 and OMD Deathtrap. It also acts as a sample folder structure to use when developing mods.

## Folder Structure

### BPMods
This folder is where you would place BP Mods - that is, mods using a custom blueprint built out in Unreal Engine, to be loaded into the game.

### LuaMods
This folder is where you would place mods that utilize Lua. A few mods are present(many unfinished), to provide examples. Also included is OMDLib - an in-progress library of useful methods to retrieve common asset types, as well as reference scripts that enable autocompletion.

### PakMods
This folder is where you would place Pak Mods - mods that primarily involve editing via Asset Editor tools, or Map edits done via Stove.

### Tools
This folder is where you would place useful tools, such as FModel, UAssetGUI, UnrealPak, etc.

### UHT
This folder is where you would place any UHT Header Dumps. Useful for understanding the game's inner workings, and for generating a functional SDK.
