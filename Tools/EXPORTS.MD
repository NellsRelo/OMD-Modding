# Game Exported Files

The `OMD3 Exports` and `OMDD Exports` folders contain useful files generated from the game via RE-UE4SS. These files are useful to various in-game tools.

## Special Note: UE4SS_Signatures
`OMDD Exports/UE4SS_Signatures` should be moved into your `OMDD/Binaries/Win64/` folder. This contains a file needed for RE-UE4SS to run on OMD Deathtrap properly.
